## React To-Do App

I'm writing this simple To-Do app as practice for React Native.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have ```Node``` installed. You can use ```npm``` to install ```create-react-native-app```.

This project uses the **Expo** client to run the native application, so make sure to have that installed in your
Android or iOS system.

Then clone the repository and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install the necessary packages. After that, you can use the following command to serve the application.

```
npm start
```

Then, all you need to do is use the **Expo** app (in a device connected to the same wireless network) to read the QR Code
that will be displayed, and the app will be running.
